We created a function so that we can adjust our volume according to our analog read pin P1, which is also our rotary angle sensor.
Furthermore, we made a bass variable to change the vibration of our motorthroughout the jingle bells song. We also added a button function 
that gives you the option to have vibration or not.

We have a forever loop that shows a certain amount of leds depending on the value of our volume variable.

This is another forever loop that plays our song with different tones from the music extension.
